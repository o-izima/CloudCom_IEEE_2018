# [Video Quality Prediction under Time-varying Loads] (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8591004)

This project compares the approach of [Yanggratoke et al.] (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7367349), who proposed a hypothesis that by gathering a large number of kernel variables, it would be possible to learn and forecast the behavior of the client system. Their hypothesis did not require detailed knowledge of the system components and interactions. This proposition is intriguing as it suggests that the network manager could potentially deploy the predictor without substantial supervision or setup, essentially "blindly".
